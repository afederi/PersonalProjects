Write a program that simulate the execution of the following FAs. You need to implement GUI (Graphic User Interface).

1) a PDA that recognizes the language {w: w is a palindrome}.
2) a PDA that recognizes the language 0^n 1^n
3) a CFL that generates the language L={w: w is a palindrome}. Your CFL can generate any string belonging to the language L input by other people.

Basically, in the GUI, if I input any string to your program, each machine will show the process of accepting or reject. When each machine moves from one state to another state, you need to highlight the new state.
